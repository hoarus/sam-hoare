a great exercise in both creativity and technical ability - I generated all the requirements \n            through facilitation of design thinking exercises, developed multiple wireframes to gather feedback,\n            and developed the PoC iteratively.</p>\n          <p>This application dynamically renders content based upon the user's sign-in status and role. Unauthenticated users are presented\n            with a professional website consisting of static pages and sign-up/sign-in forms. Once authenticated, users are presented with different \n            views depending on their role - user, business owner, and site admin.</p>\n          <p> The intended audience are Australian small business owners who wish to\n            improve workplace health and safety. They register their company as part of the sign-up process and can\n            generate a sign-up link for employees to join. When employees sign up, they are prompted to complete a short\n            survey to identify which training modules are applicable for them. The owner is then able to view the sign-up\n            status and applicable modules for each employee. Lastly, as a Site Admin, I'm able to view and delete business and users, and view, edit and delete\n            the videos associated with training modules.</p>\n          <p>While the business idea has been put on hold, this application serves as a good representation of my\n            skills. It's written in Ruby on Rails, utilizes a Devise plug-in for authentication and a PostgreSQL database for storage, and is deployed\n            via a GitLab CI/CD pipeline that I developed. Please note that the source code is stored in a private GitLab\n            repository, but access can be provided upon request.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        }\n        notes = \"Note: Due to the hosting provider I'm using (Heroku), there may be a slight delay before the application loads.\"\n      />\n        )\n      case 2:\n        return(\n          <Project\n          image = {flightBookerSnap}\n          title = \"Free Flight Booker\"\n          techStackIcons = {[railsIcon, rubyIcon, jsIcon, herokuIcon, twilioIcon]}\n          links = {[\"http://freeflightbooker.herokuapp.com/\",\"https://github.com/hoarus/odin-flight-booker\"]}\n          projectDetails = {          \n            <div className=\"project-details\">\n            <p>This application represents a small portion of the online flight search and booking\n              process.

I understand the importance of embedding security in application design from \n        my experience with security assessments and cloud control design. \n        I understand the importance of DevOps, from my work in developing \n        configuration management and platform engineering PoCs.
