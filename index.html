          <p>I developed this fullstack application as a Proof-of-Concept for a friend's business idea.
            It has the typical static pages associated with a professional website as well as an application component
            sitting behind user authentication.</p>
          <p> The intended audience are Australian small business owners who wish to
            improve workplace health and safety. They register their company as part of the sign-up process and can
            generate a sign-up link for employees to join. When employees sign up, they are prompted to complete a short
            survey to identify which training modules are applicable for them. And the owner is able to view the sign-up
            status and applicable modules for each employee.</p>
          <p>While the business idea has been put on hold, this application serves as a good representation of my
            skills. It was written in Ruby on Rails, utilises a Devise plug-in for authentication, and is deployed
            via a GitLab CI/CD pipeline that I developed. Please note that the source code is stored in a private GitLab
            repository, but access can be provided upon request.

          <p>This application represents a small portion of the online flight search and booking
            process. I have stripped it back to a minimalistic design and focused on simplified user experience.</p>
          <p>Users are able to search for flights from a select list of airports. They are then asked to provide
            passenger details for each passenger before confirming the booking. Lastly, booking confirmation emails are
            sent to all passengers.</p>
          <p>This project demonstrates my skills in being able to seed databases, develop advanced forms which create
            multiple data models simultaneously (Bookings and Passengers) and integrate with third-party add-ons (Twilio
            Sendgrid).</p>

          <p>This project is a simple pass-and-play version of the battlship board game.</p>
          <p>Users are required to input their names before playing. They are then each required to place five ships
            before the game starts. Players then take turns firing at each other's board.</p>
          <p>I wrote the underlying game logic first using Jest and practicing test driven deployment. Once all unit
            tests and the game logic were developed, I added a React UI to the app.</p>
